# 🧠 TechGadget Support Chatbot

This project is a simple yet smart customer support chatbot for **TechGadget**, built using Python. It combines **exact matching** and **fuzzy text matching** to provide accurate and flexible responses to user questions.



## 📚 Educational Context

This project was developed as part of the **"Introducing Generative AI with AWS"** course by **Udacity**.

The original exercise provided a basic rule-based chatbot. I enhanced it by:
- 🧠 Adding fuzzy matching using the `rapidfuzz` library
- 🧩 Combining it with exact intent matching for better accuracy
- 🔧 Fixing logic issues (e.g., mis-matches like "shipping" triggering "hi")
- 📝 Writing full documentation and GitHub-friendly formatting

This chatbot simulates a support assistant for a fictional company called **TechGadget** and is part of my journey to understand real-world applications of AI.
